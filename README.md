# PH_Airway_Detection
A code to detect small airways in lung CT images.

We try to extend the airway detection result using 3D slicer ver 5.6.1(http://www.slicer.org)
LungCTSegmenter in LungCTAnalyzer V 2.69(https://github.com/rbumm/SlicerLungCTAnalyzer/).

LungCTSegmenter is a good way to semi-automatically detect airways in lung CT images.

We might want to extend some of the detected airway branches, and this notebook provides one possible approach.

Note that this code is under development and will be modified a lot in the future.
